# boggle
A mock Boggle game. 

This is a game like Boggle, the classic word game. It displays a board of 16 letters. You have to find as many words as you can, where each consecutive pair of letters in the word are connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. You receive points on the basis of the length of the word you find.

Unlike the real Boggle, there is no timer; you just play on a given board for as long as you like. Whenever you want to switch to a new board (and set your points back to 0), type N. 

Enjoy! Let me know if you find any errors.
